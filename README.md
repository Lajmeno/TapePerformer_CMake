# TapePerformer

This a Audio Plugin Project made with the Juce Framework. This instrument was first developed with Pure Data. 

It was originally developed for improvisational performances with a group of people, each using different instruments. The idea was to turn a sample player into an instrument that plays unpredictable sounds. The sample was usually composed of many different music tracks making up a long piece of music. Each key of a midi keyboard plays a portion of the sample. With one slider the user can navigate through the sample - changing which portions are played - with another the distance between each sample can be changed - so that the individual portions can be very far apart and are more likely to be rather dissimilar or very close to each other and thus eventually only small variations of a particular sound.
